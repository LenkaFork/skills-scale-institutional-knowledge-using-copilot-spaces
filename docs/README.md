# OctoAcme Project Management Docs

Welcome to the OctoAcme Project Management documentation hub. This README provides a brief overview of our project management approach and quick links to all related process documents for easy access and onboarding.

## Project Management Process Summary

OctoAcme delivers projects via an iterative, cross-functional process focused on alignment, data-driven decisions, and transparency. The project lifecycle includes:

- **Initiation:** Validate ideas, align stakeholders, and define project goals with clear success criteria.
- **Planning:** Break down approved initiatives into actionable tasks, prioritize the backlog, and agree on deliverables, milestones, and dependencies.
- **Execution & Tracking:** Manage daily work through project boards, code reviews, regular standups, and progress metrics; escalate blockers as needed.
- **Risk Management & Communication:** Use a structured register for tracking risks and communicate regularly with stakeholders to ensure alignment and address dependencies or issues quickly.
- **Release & Deployment:** Standardize pre-release checks, deployment steps, and rollback plans to ensure safe and transparent releases.
- **Retrospective & Continuous Improvement:** Capture learnings after major milestones and track improvements to evolve processes over time.
- **Roles & Responsibilities:** Define clear roles for Project Managers, Product Managers, Developers, and others to ensure ownership and accountability at each stage.

Artifacts supporting this flow include the Project One-pager, Roadmap, Risk Register, Release Notes, and more. Consistent communication and documentation promote repeatable success and smooth handoff across teams.
